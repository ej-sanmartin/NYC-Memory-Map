          <h2>Welcome to My Neighborhood</h2>
          <p class="intro info-p">New York City has had a long history. First being occupied by various
             Native American tribes and then being colonized by the Dutch in the
             17th century, it has gone through a large transformation to what we
             come to know, today. New York City started at Manhattan Island's
             most Southern tip as a harbor and has grown exponentially to the grand
             city that we know today.</p>
          <p class="info-p">It expanded Northward and the Upper East Side, where I call home, has
             been growing since the early 19th century.</p>
          <p class="info-p">I have great love for this neighborhood. From the parks that line FDR Drive
             to the fancy restaurant that serve to empty my stomach as it fulls my belly.
             The people are friendly and lively and I am so happy to call this place home.</p>
          <p class="info-p">The map displays all the places I frequent in the city and even has a few spots
             that are not in the Upper East Side. These places mean a lot to me and have made
             my time in New York City memorable.</p>
